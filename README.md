#### (Repository version 0.5.5)
EEG measures of neural processing reflect visual encoding time (encodingN200) before evidence accumulation during human decision making

### Significance

Encoding of a sensory stimulus is believed to be the first step in perceptual decision making. In this study, we report evidence that visual evoked potentials (EPs) around 200 ms after stimulus presentation track the time of visual figure-ground segregation before the onset of evidence accumulation during decision making. These EP latencies vary across individuals, are modulated by external visual noise, and increase response time by x milliseconds when they increase by x milliseconds. Hierarchical Bayesian model-fitting was also used to relate these EPs to a specific cognitive parameter that tracks time related to visual encoding in a decision-making model of response time. This work adds to the growing literature that suggests that EEG signals can track the component cognitive processes of decision making.

### Hypothesis

In this study, we directly tested the hypothesis that N200 latencies (EEG stimulus-locked negative peaks occurring between 150 and 275 milliseconds in human subjects) reflect visual processing time that occurs before evidence accumulation during quick decision making.
